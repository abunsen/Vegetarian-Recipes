## Time
Active Time - 15 Minutes  
**Total Time** - 30 minutes

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 medium leeks, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 2 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 6 ears of corn, kernels cut off from cobs, cobs split in half and reserved
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 sprigs tarragon, leaves minced, stems reserved separately
- Up to 1 quart homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving

## Steps

1. Melt butter over medium heat in a pressure cooker. Add leeks and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.  

2. Add corn with cobs, bay leaves, tarragon stems, and enough chicken stock to barely cover corn (the cobs might still be sticking out a bit). Stir to combine. Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook for 15 minutes. Release pressure using quick-release method and uncover. Discard corn cobs, bay leaves, and tarragon stems.

3. Working in batches, transfer mixture to the jar of a blender. To prevent the blender lid from exploding off, remove the central lid and cover the space with a folded kitchen towel. Start blender slowly and gradually increase speed to high. Blend until completely smooth, adding more chicken stock or water as necessary. Season to taste with salt and pepper and press through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot. Repeat with remaining soup.

4. Serve soup with minced tarragon leaves and chives and a drizzle of olive oil.
