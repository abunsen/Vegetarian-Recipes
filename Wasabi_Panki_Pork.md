## Time

**Total Time**

## Ingredients
- 2/3 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
- 1 large egg white, lightly beaten
- 4 (4-ounce) boneless center-cut loin pork chops (about 1/2 inch thick)
- 1 teaspoon peanut oil
- Cooking spray
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon bottled ground fresh ginger (such as Spice World)
- 1/3 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons sake or dry sherry
- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon wasabi paste
- 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions

## Steps
1. Place panko in a shallow dish. Place egg white in another shallow dish. Dip pork in egg white; dredge in panko.

2. Heat peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat; add pork. Cook for 4 minutes on each side or until done. Remove pork from pan; sprinkle with salt.

3. Reduce heat to medium. Add ginger to pan; cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Combine broth and the next 4 ingredients (through wasabi) in a small bowl, stirring well with a whisk. Add broth mixture to pan, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in green onions. Spoon sauce over pork.
