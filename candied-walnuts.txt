4 Cups whole walnuts
1/2 Cup sugar (regular white cane variety)
Directions:
Bring water to boil. Add walnuts; return to boil. Rinse in warm water through colander. Drain. Fry in large fry pan immediately with sugar until dark golden brown.
Will stay crunchy in airtight container for at least a few days. Fresh cracked pepper can be added during frying for a delightful different flavor.
