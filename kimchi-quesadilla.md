## Time

1. Prep - 10-15 min
2. Cooking - 10-15 min
3. Cooling - 5 min

**Total time** - 25-35min

## Ingredients

1. Corn tortillas (At least 2)
2. Shredded Cheese
3. Kimchi (My favorite is Firefly Kimchi, but if you're feeling fancy you make your own a month or two prior to this)
4. [optional: Meat substitute]

## Steps

Put your skillet on the stove on medium heat to warm it up (I prefer cast iron).
Layout a corn tortilla.
Spread a layer of cheese evenly over the tortilla, the amount of cheese you use is personal preference.
If the kimchi is in large pieces, julienne that -ish or chop it up a bit. 
Spread some kimchi over the top of the cheese. I use 2 or 3 forkfuls for the 6 inch tortillas.   
If you have a meat substitute like tofu add a bit on top of the kimchi.

*Make sure you haven't enough kimchi or protein to completely cover up all of the cheese. You need at least a band of visible cheese on the outer edge of the tortilla. 

Sprinkle a little bit more cheese over the top of everything.

Carefully slide the tortilla, cheese, and kimchi into the skillet. Extra points for not having cheese or kimchi fall off.
Add a second tortilla to the top and gently press it down.

As the bottom tortilla heats up, the cheese will melt. At this points, gently press the edges of the top tortilla into the cheese of the bottom tortilla so it sticks. 

The bottom tortilla won't take long to cook. Use a utensil to check the bottom of it until it reaches a golden brown.The cheese should also be melted at this point.
Flip the whole thing over so the top tortilla can cook to the same golden brown. If cheese has already melted onto the top tortilla (and it should), flipping is easy. If you suck at flipping, use a spatula to get under it and your other hand to hold the top tortilla in place while you flip. 

## Eat the fuck out of it.
