# Chicken Stock

## Ingredients
- Chicken Carcass (I freeze the leftovers from butchering whole chickens)
- 4-5 Carrots
- 1 Head of Celery
- 1 Onion
- Spices
  - 2 Bay Leaves (Fresher == Better, Dried shit sucks)
  - 2 tbsp. Toasted Peppercorns
  - 1 Star Anise (Optional but adds a real depth of flavor)
  - Kombu, find this @ the asian grocery store

## Time
- Prep - 20 Min  
- Active Cooking - 30 Min (You can overlap some of this with the Prep)
- Passive Cooking - 2 - 6 Hours (Pressure Cookers are your friends)

## Process
1. Heat pressure cooker w/o lid on Med-High and a healthy amount of Optional
2. Rough chop your onion, carrot and cleaned celery adding to the pot as you go
3. Let those cook for 20 min or so, should be fragrant and soft
4. Toast your Peppercorns and anise in a pan on Med-High for a few minutes (Careful not to burn)
5. Deglaze your pot with white wine or stock (I buy cheap box wine and keep it in the pantry for tasks like this)
6. Once your veggies are done add the frozen chicken carcass and Spices
7. Pressure Cooker  
    - If you're using a pressure cooker add water to the fill-line and put on your lid
    - Turn on High until the cooker reaches temp and turn it down to low
    - Cook for 1.5-2 Hours  
8. Regular Pot
  - Add water to the top and simmer for 5-6 Hours or to your hearts content
9. Once it's done cooking remove it from heat, strain out all solids. I use a [chinois](https://www.amazon.com/Winco-Stainless-Reinforced-Bouillon-Strainer/dp/B016AQ0JM6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1471780728&sr=8-3&keywords=chinois).
10. To make my life easy I fill 32 oz. [deli containers](https://www.amazon.com/Delitainers-Microwavable-Container-Set-Lids/dp/B004NKBTY4/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1471780668&sr=8-7&keywords=32+oz+deli+container) (don't buy the cheap thin ones) then freeze them.
11. Then when you need to make soup, rice, quinoa, or really any recipe with stock just 10 min in the microwave and you have high quality home made stock at your disposal.
