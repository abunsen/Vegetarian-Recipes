- 1 large or 2 medium cauliflower heads, cored and cut into large chunks
- 1 TBSP coconut or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 cup cashews, toasted & chopped
- 1/2 cup currants, raisins or chopped dried apricots

1. Using the shredding blade of a food processor grate the cauliflower (alternatively, you can do it by hand with a box grater). You should end up with 6-7 cups grated cauliflower.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium. Add the grated cauliflower and chopped onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender and lightly browned in spots.
2. Add the garlic, curry powder, cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 more minutes. Stir in cashews and currants. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
